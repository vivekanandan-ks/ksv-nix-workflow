# The Story of ksv-fastapi-nix-shell

Welcome to ksv-fastapi-nix-shell – a project built with the vision of streamlining your development setup. Imagine starting your workday with a fully pre-configured environment in an instant. That’s exactly what this project offers.

## The Challenge
Traditional development environments often require tedious setup procedures that waste valuable time. We wanted a solution that lets you dive straight into coding without any hassle.

## The Solution: One Command to Rule Them All
By utilizing the `nix develop` command, our project provides an out-of-the-box development environment:
- **Reproducibility:** Every developer gets the same precise setup defined in our configuration file (`shell.nix` or a similar flake configuration).
- **Simplicity:** Forget multiple setup steps; a single `nix develop` command is all you need.

## A Journey Towards Efficiency
In creating ksv-fastapi-nix-shell, we embraced the philosophy of minimalism and efficiency. This project embodies the idea that setting up an ideal work environment should be as simple as running one command:
```
nix develop
```
With this command, you no longer need to worry about dependency management or environment mismatches – everything is handled automatically.

## Get Started
- **Step 1:** Install Nix from [NixOS](https://nixos.org/).
- **Step 2:** Clone the repository and switch to the project directory.
- **Step 3:** Run `nix develop` and experience a seamlessly configured development environment.

Join us in embracing a future where work environments are ready in an instant, so you can focus on innovation instead of setup.
