# ksv-fastapi-nix-shell

## Introduction
ksv-fastapi-nix-shell is a project designed to demonstrate how quickly you can configure a complete development environment with just one command: `nix develop`. This setup ensures consistency and removes the manual overhead of configuring dependencies.

## Installation

1. **Install Nix:**
   - Follow the official instructions at [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) to install Nix.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Run:
     ```

     ```

3. **Enter the Development Environment:**
   - Simply execute:
     ```
     nix develop
     ```
   - This command reads the configuration (from `shell.nix` or similar) to set up the environment automatically.

## Usage
